Team Points:
  20/20 points for a working platformer with a filled out README
  16/20 points for having enough sizable changes (4 changes if in a group of 1, 5 changes if in a group of 2, 6 changes if in a group of 3, 8 changes if in a group of 4)
  -pink slime is broken because the script is missing. other than that, I see sprint, health, sfx, and double jump.
  8/10 points for following the PR process correctly, including reviewing your teammates’ code (not required for solo projects, instead points will come from having enough changes)
  -Used PRs a lot, but many changes put directly into the main branch and not very many reviews. Looks like Graceson just checked everything in.

44/50

I can't figure out who ZoomTroopo is. They haven't filled out a README in any of their repositories plus I don't see any major contributions beyond adding to the map. I don't even have submission from them for the TD to identify them, so I'm going to count you as a group of 3 for now rather than penalizing the rest of you.

EDIT: I figured out ZoomTroopo is Franklin.
