## Mason Reflection

When making this I realized just how much more complicated these games are going to be to make than I had originally thought. I'm definitely going to need to study how things are made through videos to get a good understanding of the language before I can efficiently make or debug anything.
The health system was a major snag for me because I haven't quite gotten Godot down just yet and navigating the various controls in the engine is kind of confusing if you don't know what you're doing. Luckily Graceson is a life saver and helped me out with it.
The shift to sprint wasn't a big deal for me to make except for figuring out how to make a constant into a variable. This problem was quickly solved and the feature itself was painless to implement and had no real conflicts.
That's about all I have to reflect on for this project. I have lots of learning to do that's for sure.
